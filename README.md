"The vitality of language lies in its ability to limn the actual, imagined and possible lives of its speakers, readers, writers. Although its poise is sometimes in displacing experience it is not a substitute for it. It arcs toward the place where meaning may lie." -- Toni Morrison


"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we know." -- Marvin Minsky


"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together." -- Georges Seurat


Nitwit is a machine, a machine of the esoteric language variety, a machine dealing not with problems that actually exist, but the solutions to ones that don't, a machine not only of intellect, though that is important, but of what it means to mean, a machine of the struggle between the "down to earth" and the great, grand, profound "head in the clouds."

Mostly it's just a project for putting the strange questions in life into a computer.
